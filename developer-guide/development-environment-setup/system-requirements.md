# System Requirements

#### System Requirements to Run a Spring Boot 3 and Angular 16 App Development Setup

To effectively run a development environment for a Spring Boot 3 backend and an Angular 16 frontend, you'll need to ensure your system meets the following requirements:

**Hardware Requirements:**

1. **Processor (CPU):**
   * Minimum: Dual-core processor (e.g., Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5)
   * Recommended: Quad-core processor or higher for better performance
2. **Memory (RAM):**
   * Minimum: 8 GB
   * Recommended: 16 GB or higher (especially if running other services like databases or Docker containers)
3. **Storage:**
   * Minimum: 50 GB of available disk space (for development tools, dependencies, and project files)
   * Recommended: SSD with 100+ GB of free space for faster build times and overall performance
4. **Graphics:**
   * Integrated or discrete GPU (not required but useful for better performance in resource-intensive IDEs or UI tools)
