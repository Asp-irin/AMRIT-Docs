# Software dependencies

**1. Operating System:**

The development environment for a Spring Boot 3 and Angular 16 application can be set up on any modern operating system. Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

* **Windows 10/11 (64-bit)**: Suitable for most development setups.
* **macOS (Big Sur or later)**: Offers great compatibility with open-source tooling and a Unix-based system.
* **Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora, etc.)**: Popular among developers for its performance, flexibility, and ease of use in programming environments.

#### **2. Java Development Kit (JDK):**

Spring Boot 3 requires **Java 17** (LTS version) as it offers long-term support and compatibility.

* **Version**: Java 17 (LTS).
* **Installation Guide**:
  * [**Oracle JDK**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html): Official JDK from Oracle with licensing and support.
  * [**OpenJDK**](https://jdk.java.net/17/): Free and open-source implementation.
*   **Verify Installation**: Once installed, verify by running the following command:

    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

    It should display Java 17.

#### **3. Node.js and npm (for Angular 16):**

Node.js is essential for Angular development, as it powers the Angular CLI, package management, and builds.

* **Version**: Node.js 18+ (for Angular 16+).
* **Installation Guide**:
  * [**Node.js Official Downloads**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Download the LTS version for the best stability and support.
*   **Verify Installation**: After installing, verify by running:

    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

#### **4. Angular CLI:**

The Angular CLI helps you scaffold and manage Angular applications.

* **Version**: Angular CLI 16.x.
*   **Installation Command**: Install Angular CLI globally via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli@16
    ```
* **Verify Installation**: Run `ng version` to confirm the CLI is properly installed.

#### **5. Spring Boot:**

Spring Boot simplifies the development of Java-based enterprise applications by providing pre-configured templates and reducing boilerplate.

* **Version**: Spring Boot 3.x.
* **Build Tool**: Maven (preferred) or Gradle.
* **Installation Command (Maven)**: Maven is a build automation tool used for managing dependencies and packaging your Spring Boot project.
  * [**Maven Installation Guide**](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
*   After installing Maven, verify with:

    ```bash
    mvn -version
    ```

#### **6. Development Environment:**

Youâ€™ll need integrated development environments (IDEs) that support Java and TypeScript for backend and frontend development, respectively.

* **IDE for Backend (Spring Boot)**:
  * [**IntelliJ IDEA**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/): Great for Java-based development and Spring Boot. It has dedicated support for Spring.
  * [**Eclipse IDE**](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/): A popular open-source IDE with Spring Boot support.
  * [**Spring Tool Suite (STS)**](https://spring.io/tools): A specialized IDE tailored for Spring applications.
* **IDE for Frontend (Angular)**:
  * [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/): A lightweight and highly customizable editor for TypeScript and Angular development.
  * [**WebStorm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/): A feature-rich IDE with built-in Angular support.

#### **7. Database:**

AMRIT platform requires a database, we use MySQL, a relational database.&#x20;

* **MySQL**:
  * **Version**: MySQL 8+.
  * Download Mysql from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
  * After installation, use MySQL Workbench or the command line to manage your database.

Configure your Spring Boot application with the required database connection properties in the `application.properties` file.

#### **8. Caching:**

To improve performance, we use caching solutions.

* **Redis** is a popular in-memory data store used for caching in Spring Boot apps.
  * Download Redis from [here](https://redis.io/docs/latest/get-started/)
  * Redis is integrated into Spring Boot via the `spring-data-redis` library.

#### **9. Other Tools:**

* **Git**: Version control system.
  * Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  *   After installing, verify by running:

      ```bash
      git --version
      ```
* **NVM (Node Version Manager)**: To manage multiple Node.js versions if needed.
  * Download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
* **Browser**: The latest version of Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge is recommended for testing and debugging Angular apps.

#### **10. Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Memory Allocation**: Spring Boot applications, especially large ones, may require a substantial amount of memory. Allocate 2 GB or more to the JVM to avoid performance issues during development.

    ```bash
    export JAVA_OPTS="-Xms2g -Xmx4g"
    ```
