# How to get help

**Overview**

If you need assistance with the AMRIT Platform, there are several ways you can get help. Whether you're facing technical issues, have questions about how to use the platform, or want to contribute to the project, the following resources are available to support you.

**GitHub Discussions**

Our primary hub for community interaction is the [GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/PSMRI/discussions). Here, you can:

* **Ask questions:** If you're new to the platform or have specific queries, feel free to ask. Our community and maintainers are here to help.
* **Start discussions:** Engage with other users and developers by starting discussions on topics related to the platform, healthcare technology, or anything else relevant.
* **Share ideas:** Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Share it in the forum to get feedback and collaborate with others.
* **Report issues:** If you encounter any problems or bugs, check the existing discussions to see if the issue has already been addressed. If not, you can start a new discussion or head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/PSMRI/AMRIT/issues) page to report it.

**Documentation**

Before reaching out for help, it's a good idea to check our Documentation for answers. The documentation covers everything from getting started with the platform to advanced development and customization topics.
